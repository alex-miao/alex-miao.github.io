I am a senior at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science and a master's degree in computer science. My interests include blockchains, cryptography, probability, cooking, and reading non-fiction. I am currently involved in cryptography research (specifically, in the topic of multiparty computation) and running the Penn Blockchain Club. This semester I am also working part time at Commonwealth Labs as a software engineer on Edgeware, a WebAssembly smart contract blockchain with on-chain governance built on Substrate.
